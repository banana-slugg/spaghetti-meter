# The Spaghetti Meter

Real-time gauge of the amount of spaghetti the current vibe is giving off.

Currently in Alpha. Pretty much nothing is working at the moment except basic interactions with the [backend](https://github.com/crims1n/spaghetti-backend).

Built with Preact and Tailwind (soon).

## TODO

-   Add Tailwind

-   Start actually making the meter
